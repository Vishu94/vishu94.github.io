<p>Third party Sampling provides transparent mechanism to scrutinise the coal quality of the coal dispatched to customers and to curb disputes between among its all stakeholders. Also, coal grade assessment plays an important criterion for revisiting mine grades.
Quality Council of India (QCI) has undertaken 3rd Party Sampling, Testing and Analysis of coal supplied through special forward e-auction for power consumer/s and linkage auction for non-power consumers. Further, the scope of work has been extended to spot e auction/ special spot e auction/ Shakti Scheme.
